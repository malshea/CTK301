        <h2>Audio and Music Production</h2>
        <p>Here are a few of my audio projects that I have been working on throught my time at ISU.</p>
        <audio controls autobuffer autoplay>
            <source src="Foley Narrative.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>This is a Foley Narrative I created with my group. We used everyday objects such as jackets and tissue paper
            to replicate the sounds of someone walking into a classroom, sitting down, pulling out their computer, and
            writing an essay about the camping trip they went on that weekend.</p>
        <audio controls autobuffer autoplay>
            <source src="Loop Based Comp.wav" type="audio/mpeg">
        </audio>
        <p>This is a Loop Based Composition I created with just the sounds of one of my group members beatboxing, my
            voice, and someone playing piano.</p>
