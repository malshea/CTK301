        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mallory Shea. I am from Galesburg, Illinois and I attend Illinois State University. This will be
            my fifth year here.</p>

        <p>I have a passion for listening to and making music. I loved music growing up and have always known that I
            want to persure a career somewhere in music. In college, I started discovering videos about music production
            and I instantly fell in love.</p>

        <p>I am graduating Illinois State University with a degree in Audio and Music Production. Unlike some in my
            field, my dream career isn't out in LA being a top-shot music producer. My dream career is working with
            music. I want to work for someone who values music the way that I do. Wherever I end up, I want to make a
            positive impact on lives with music.</p>
